Geodesic Unwelding Algorithm

The implementation of this project is distributed across three files. It implements a simple Object Oriented wrapper of the MPC library to reduce the complexity of the code and to be able to use arithmetic operators.

mpcomplex.cpp and mpcomplex.h - Implementation of the C++ Class.

geounweld.cpp - Implementation of the algorithm and output.

This project depends on the MPC library available on http://www.multiprecision.org/.
