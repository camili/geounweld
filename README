Geodesic Unwelding Algorithm

The implementation of this project is distributed across three files. It implements a simple Object Oriented wrapper of the MPC library to reduce the complexity of the code and to be able to use arithmetic operators.

mpcomplex.cpp and mpcomplex.h - Implementation of the C++ Class.

geounweld.cpp - Implementation of the algorithm and output.

This project depends on the MPC library available on http://www.multiprecision.org/. The makefile assumes that the MPC library is already installed and in the /usr/local/lib/ directory. 

To create a binary run the make command on a terminal.

You can use this command to run the geounweld program:

./geounweld 5 100 bdata.ga bdata_results

5 corresponds to the number of intermediate points. It defaults to 5
20 corresponds to the number of precision bits in the computations. It defaults to 100.
bdata.ga corresponds to the input file. It defaults to bdata.ga
bdata_results is the folder where the results files are going to be generated. It defaults to results.
